## About
A subscription-based platform where content creators can earn money from users who subscribe to their content by purchasing an exclusive NFT.
## Problems solved by our project-
1. Most centralized creator platforms today take away a huge cut of the pay received by the creators thereby reducing their profits.We solved this problem by creating a decentralized subscription-based streaming service where audiences can access their favorite creatorâ€™s content by buying an exclusive NFT and paying a subscription fee.

2. Payments management has been a headache many times. We built a money streaming utility so that we can stream and transfer money seamlessly with a click of a button. Also managing your team members and giving them timely payouts can be a nightmare as well as affect your productivity. We solved this problem by using the Instant Distribution method to distribute the revenue received by the creator to its team members.

3. In an era where 80% of all Internet bandwidth is consumed by video streaming, Implementing video streaming with proper transcoding has become a lot expensive. We used live peers protocol to reduce the cost by 50 times.

4. Traditional authentication processes involve a lot of hectic procedures like numerous logins, 2FAs, etc. At Mystiq your crypto wallet is your identity and is an one-click process.
